<h1 align="center">GFP Molecular Dynamics Educational Project</h1>
 
<div align="justify">
 
This repository accompanies the paper **“The GFP rainbow: an educational tool for teaching molecular modeling and molecular dynamics”**, designed for undergraduate and graduate students to learn fundamental principles of molecular modeling, MD simulations, and trajectory analysis.
 
The repository provides all input structures and scripts required to reproduce the full workflow described in the accompanying publication. In addition, all results and intermediate output files generated by running these scripts are also included. Students and educators can follow each stage independently or run the complete project sequentially.

## Repository Structure
 
### 1-2-preparation_of_initial_structures
- Original PDB structures of the GFP variants used in the project.  
- Prepared structures of each GFP variant and their corresponding chromophores.  
- Students use these files as starting points for parameterization and obtention of topology and coordinate files for MD simulations.
 
### 3-system-parameterization
- A single script for each GFP variant, which generates the prep and frcmod files for the corresponding chromophore, as well as the topology (`.top`) and coordinate (`.crd`) files for the complete GFP system, ready for MD simulations.  
- All outputs produced by running these scripts, including intermediate files, are also provided.
 
### 4-MD_simulations
- A single script and all necessary input files for running GPU-accelerated MD simulations for each GFP variant.  
- Outputs generated after running the simulations, including trajectory files and all intermediate files from each step of the simulation.
 
### 5-MD_analysis
- For each GFP variant, independent scripts for monitoring thermodynamic properties, performing structural analysis, and running energetic analysis.  
- Output data files containing the results for each property analyzed.

## Software Requirements and Installation
 
The following software packages are required to reproduce the project. Installation guides are available on the respective websites.
 
### 1. PyMOL

- Installation tutorial: [https://ambermd.org/Installation.php](https://ambermd.org/Installation.php)  
- Licensing: Free for non-commercial use (some restrictions apply).
 
### 3. MM-ISMSA
An ultrafast and accurate scoring function for protein–protein and protein–ligand interactions, used here to calculate total binding free energy and its decomposition into van der Waals, electrostatic, and solvation terms.

## Running the Scripts
 
Once the required software is installed, all scripts can be executed directly without modification.
 
Each script:
- Automatically retrieves the necessary input files from the appropriate directory.  
- Runs the required calculations sequentially.  
- Generates a new directory for the corresponding GFP variant containing all output and result files.  
 
Users can follow the workflow step-by-step or execute each part independently for instructional or demonstration purposes.
